i'm like a crow on a wire
you're the shining distraction that makes me fly home
i'm like a boat on the water
you're the raise on the waves that calm my mind
oh, everytime

and i know in my heart, you're not a constant star
and yeah, i've let you use me from the day that we first met
but i'm not done yet
