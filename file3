there's a lightning in your eyes, i can't deny
then there's me inside a sinking boat running out of time
without you, i'll never make it out alive
but i know, yes, i know, we'll be alright

there's a devil in your smile, it's chasing me
and every time i turn around it's only gaining speed
there's a moment when you finally realize
there's no way you can change the rolling tide
but i know, yes i know, that i'll be fine

this time i'm ready to run
escape from the city and follow the sun
'cause i wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
i don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
this time i'm ready to run
wherever you are is the place i belong
'cause i wanna be free, and I wanna be young
i will never look back now i'm ready to run
i'm ready to run
